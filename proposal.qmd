Family-related metadata: 1 indicates trait presence, a whereas 0 indicates trait absence. SS: Combined (any sexually selected trait), A: Auditory, G: Gustatory, O: Olfactory, T:Tactile, V: Visual, C: Male-male competition, F: Female choice, K: Female-female competition, M: Male choice, S: Intersexual conflict.

Rates of trait evolution metadata: A: Auditory, G: Gustatory, O:Olfactory, T:Tactile, V: Visual, C: Male-male competition, F: Female choice, K: Female-female competition, M: Male choice, S: Intersexual conflict.

```{python}
#description of each dataset
print("1. Evolution Rate Dataset")
print(f"- File: animals_rateof_evolution.csv")
print(f"- Dimensions: {evo_shape[0]} rows × {evo_shape[1]} columns")
print("- Description: Contains continuous values representing the evolutionary rate of various sexual traits across different animal taxa.")

print("2. Family-Level Trait Dataset")
print(f"- File: family-related_data.csv")
print(f"- Dimensions: {fam_shape[0]} rows × {fam_shape[1]} columns")
print("- Description: Encodes presence (1) or absence (0) of various sexually selected traits (e.g., visual, auditory, male-male competition) at the family level.")
```

I chose these two datasets, because the *family-related data* contains binary values (0 or 1) for various sexually selected traits, making it well-suited for training machine learning models across a diverse range of animal families. It could be great for hands-on experience with multi-class classification and feature selection. I may plan to use SHAP to help interpret the model's predictions and feature contributions primarily for both data depending on the model performance. The *evolutionary rates data* includes continuous values (some greater than 0 and some zeros), which allows for a comparative analysis to determine which approach—binary presence or continuous evolutionary rates—offers greater predictive power.

## Questions

-   How accurately can a machine learning model classify animal taxa based on the binary presence of sexually selected traits?
-   Do evolutionary origin rates of sexual traits provide stronger predictive power than binary trait presence when classifying animal taxa?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analysis plan

### Overview

The primary objective is to assess and compare the predictive power and interpretability of both data.

### Dataset Descriptions

**1. Family-Level Trait Data (`family_df`)**

-   Format: Binary indicators (`0` or `1`) for the presence or absence of sexually selected traits.

-   Traits include: `SS`, `A`, `G`, `O`, `T`, `V`, `C`, `F`, `K`, `M`, `S`

-   Each row represents a taxonomic family.

-   The target variable will likely be a categorical label such as `Class` or a user-defined taxon.

**2. Evolutionary Rates Data (`evolution_df`)**

-   Format: Continuous numerical values representing the origin rates of the same traits listed above.

-   Each row represents a taxonomic group.

-   Target variable will match the one used in the binary dataset for comparison.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA will be performed separately for both datasets:

-   Distribution plots for each trait.

-   Correlation matrix or correlation heatmap

-   Summary statistics for continuous traits.

-   Count plots or bar charts showing trait prevalence by taxonomic group (e.g., class or family).

### Modeling Approach

For both datasets:

1\. Data Preparation

-   I will double check for any null values.

-   I will encode target variable (animals taxa) using `LabelEncoder`. For the evolutionary rates, I will convert any values \> 0 to 1 and hot-encode these numerical columns (sexually selected traits) for the presence of sexually selected traits.

-   For `evolution_df`, I will standardize these sexually selected traits feature using `StandardScaler`.

2\. Models to Use

-   `DecisionTreeClassifier`

-   `RandomForestClassifier`

-   `LogisticRegression`

3\. Evaluation Metrics

-   Accuracy score

-   Confusion matrix

-   Classification report

-   Cross-validation score (`cross_val_score`)

-   ROC-AUC score

4\. Model Interpretation

-   I will use SHAP to interpret trained models.

-   I will generate SHAP summary plots and bar plots to highlight influential traits.

-   I will compare interpretability between models trained on binary and continuous data for the evolutionary rates.

### Comparison and Interpretation

-   I will interpret the classification performance across both data and answer both questions. Then, I will draw conclusions about which dataset format (binary or continuous) provides stronger predictive insights for question #2.

-   I will analyze SHAP outputs to identify which traits contribute most to predictions.

-   I may also interpret which family has sexually selected traits and explain the results (if I have more time during the presentation).
